# snake

A cool snake game I made in school today.

Apples spawn in random positions as either a red (normal) or an orange (poisonous) apple.<br>
When eaten, normal apples will add to your score. If your score is a 100, you win.<br>
Sometimes, a poisonous apple will disappear and reappear in a random position as either a normal or poisonous apple.
