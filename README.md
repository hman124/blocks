A cool game I made today.

Apples spawn in random positions as either a red (normal), blue (rare), orange (poisonous), or a green (rotten) apple.<br>
Eating a red apple will add 1 point, while eating a blue apple will add 5 points.<br>
Green apples will subtract 5 points and orange apples will kill you. If you have less than 5 points, and you eat a green apple, you will also die.
